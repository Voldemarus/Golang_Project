Structures 

Program defines Figure interface and two structures, which conforms to it - Rectangle and Circle 

Interface contains single functon definition - area() 

Then isBigger() function is defined which operates with Interface types and returnsFigure with biggest area. 

Next, map is created with several Ccircles and rectangles. 

Program finds the biigest figure and then scans map again to get its name.
