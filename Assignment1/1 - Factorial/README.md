Factorial - multithreaded calculator 

Current version - without concurent processing 

Two recursive function defined - sum() and factorial() 

The main idea is to implement multithread version of sum() with dichotomy algorithm 
each sum is calculated by recursive procedure - initial interval is splitted to two and sum 
for each part is calculated. Then we add left and right partial sum together.
