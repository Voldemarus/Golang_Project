Linked List implementation 

Allows to store arbitrary types of data in the list

Contains several methods defined 

- append to end of the list
- get first element
- insert on the start of the list
- get tail of the list
- get count of elements in the list
- get last element
- reverse order of elements in the list

Example:

Colombina:3-LinkedList 1$ go run LinkedList.go 
Initial list
66.33 -> float: -> 44 -> Second -> 22 -> Start

List properties:
First element::  66.33
Last element::  Start
Count of elements::  6

Reversed list:
Start -> 22 -> Second -> 44 -> float: -> 66.33

Tail of the reversed list:
22 -> Second -> 44 -> float: -> 66.33

Append array  to the end of reversedList::
Start -> 22 -> Second -> 44 -> float: -> 66.33 -> [1 2 3 4 5]
